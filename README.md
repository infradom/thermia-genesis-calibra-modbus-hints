# thermia-genesis-calibra

Information meant for integration of Thermia heatpumps (genesis platform) in Home Asssistant;
Modbus BMS must be enabled on your Thermia system (I use modbus TCP).

DISCLAIMER: use at your own risk, don't complain if it eats your dog or burns your house ....

For the Calibra, I managed to use the https://github.com/CJNE/thermiagenesis Home Assistant integration, which works fine for most parameters.
Unfortunately, this integration currently misses some interesting registers:
 - BMS supplied outside temperature
 - Energy performance parameters (COP today for heat and tapwater)

As I currently have no time to contribute to the mentioned integration, I added these modbus entities manually.
These missing registers can be enabled by adding a modbus section to your config/configuration.yaml file:


```

As some of these registers are not (yet) documented, I have to issue a severe disclaimer: use at your own risk, don't complain if it eats your dog or burns your house !!


This has been tested on both Calibra Cool 7 and Calibra Cool Eco 8 systems running software version 16.

Installation: Add the content of this section to your config/configuration.yaml file, edit to provide the correct IP address and restart your system
Add the new entities to your preferred dashboard.

I use the BMS controlled temperature to use the 4 hour offset temperature forecast, as my floor heating has almost a 4 hour delay.

<img width="433" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0916b08a-05db-4fae-a5c6-0138bc0bc766">


The 4-hour forecast is derived from the met.no weather integration and is polled every hour with following section in config/configuration.yaml

```
template:
  - trigger:
      - platform: time_pattern
        hours: /1
      - platform: event
        event_type: event_template_reloaded
    action:
      - variables:
          w: weather.forecast_home # you may have named it differently
      - service: weather.get_forecasts
        data:
          type: hourly
        target:
          entity_id: '{{ w }}'
        response_variable: hourly
    sensor:
      - name: "temperature forecast 4h"
        unique_id: temperature_forecast_4h
        unit_of_measurement: "Â°C"
        device_class: temperature
        state: "{{ hourly[w].forecast[3].temperature }}"


```
An automation is used to propagate changes in this forecast to the Thermia outside temperature:

```
alias: Thermia buitentemperatuur forecast
description: ""
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id:
      - sensor.temperature_forecast_4h
  - trigger: state
    entity_id:
      - switch.bms_controlled_temperature
conditions: []
actions:
  - action: climate.set_temperature
    metadata: {}
    data:
      temperature: "{{ states('sensor.temperature_forecast_4h') }}"
    target:
      entity_id: climate.bms_outdoor_temperature
mode: single

```
